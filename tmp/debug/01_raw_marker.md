The letters are arranged vertically, occupying the left, center, and right sections of the layout, creating a stacked effect. Each word is distinctly centered, with "SCHMIDT" on the top, followed by "HAMMER" in the middle, and "LASSEN" at the bottom. The overall color scheme showcases a stark contrast, as the text is rendered in a deep black against a light gray background, enhancing visibility and making it striking. This arrangement suggests a branding or logo purpose, establishing a clear identity for the entity represented by the name.

Image /page/3/Figure/3 description: The image presents a detailed overview of the international work stages used in various countries during the architectural or project development process. The layout consists of a structured grid that categorizes different stages of work into rows and columns, allowing for a quick comparison across regions. 

At the top of the graphic is the main title "INTERNATIONAL WORK STAGES OVERVIEW" followed by the subtitle "Quick comparison," indicating the document's purpose as a comparative tool. Below this, there is a section header that separates the phases of work into five main categories: "PREPARATION," "DESIGN PROPOSAL," "PRODUCTION," "ON SITE," and "POSTCONSTRUCTION." Each category is highlighted and signifies distinct stages of project development.

The first section under "PREPARATION" includes rows filled with country-specific processes. The countries represented are: 
- \*\*DENMARK:\*\* Stages 1 to 6 are "Ideoplæg," "Byggerprogram," "Dispositionsforslag," "Projektforslag," "Udbudprojekt," and "Udførelsesprojekt."
- \*\*NORWAY:\*\* Stages 1 to 5 are "Utredningsfase," "Skisseprosjekt (Program og Konseptutvikling)," "Forsprosjektutvikling," "Rammetillatelse," and "Detaljprosjekt."
- \*\*SWEDEN:\*\* Stages 1 to 3 are "Förstudie," "Program Hantering," and "Bygghandling."
- \*\*USA:\*\* Stages 1 to 3 are "Schematic Design," "Design Development," and "Construction Documents."
- \*\*UK:\*\* Displays a detailed segment with phases "Stage 0" through "Stage 7," with specific tasks like "Strategic definition," "Preparation and Brief," "Concept Design," "Developed Design," and so on.
- \*\*GERMANY:\*\* Divided into LP stages from LP1 to LP9 detailing various phases like "Grundlagenermittlung," "Vorplanung mit Kostenschätzung," and more.
- \*\*LUXEMBOURG / FRANCE:\*\* Features stages named "Esquisse / Concours" and "AVP Avant Projet" along with several descriptions of phases such as "APS Avant Projet Définitif."
- \*\*NETHERLANDS:\*\* The entry shows "MINK" which is unclear without additional context.
- \*\*SPAIN:\*\* Lists stages "1" through "4" as "Proyecto Básico," "Dirección de Obra," and "Final de Obra."
- \*\*SWITZERLAND:\*\* Highlights stages "2" and some texts that are difficult to decipher, noted as "YAGN."

The visual representation effectively conveys the sequence and terminology unique to each country’s project phases. Each country's specific stages are listed vertically, corresponding horizontally with the primary work categories, creating a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate grid. The information is neatly organized, allowing for straightforward comparisons between how different nations approach similar stages in project development.

Image /page/4/Picture/2 description: The image features the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" prominently displayed in a clean, modern font. The words are presented in all capital letters, suggesting a bold and professional branding style. The text is arranged in three horizontal lines: "SCHMIDT" on the top line, "HAMMER" on the middle line, and "LASSEN" on the bottom line. All three lines are centered, contributing to a balanced and cohesive layout. The font is weighty and invites attention, possibly indicating that this is the branding for an architectural or design firm. The background appears to be a light, neutral color that enhances the contrast, making the black text stand out effectively. There are no additional visual elements or graphics present, emphasizing the simplicity and clarity of the design.

Image /page/4/Figure/4 description: The image is a structured flowchart detailing the phases of project development as outlined by Schmidt Hammer Lassen. The overall purpose of this visual is to illustrate the sequential phases and categories involved in project development, specifically contrasting processes in Denmark and the USA.

The layout is organized into several horizontal sections, each representing a distinct phase of project development: Preparation, Design Proposal, Production, On Site, and Postconstruction. Each section is divided into various stages, which are differentiated by different colors and text boxes that categorize the workflow.

In the 'Preparation' section, the phases are labeled in Danish: 1 (Ideøpleg), 2 (Byggeprogram), and 3 (Forslag) alongside the corresponding phase for the USA labeled as '1 (Schematic Design)'. This part effectively introduces the preparatory steps commonly undertaken before diving into design.

The next major section is titled 'DESIGN PROPOSAL', which is divided into Concept Design and Project Design categories. Within 'Concept Design', there are sequential categories: 'Sketch / Competition', 'Predesign', and 'Conceptual design', concluding with an 'Interim Hand Over' label that signifies a handover moment in the process. The 'Project Design' category includes a prominent section marked 'DESIGN PHASE', indicating a primary evaluation stage in the design journey.

Beneath 'Project Design', the flowchart further splits into 'Schematic Design' labeled in light green, which highlights the 'QUANTITY' aspect, and 'Design Development', which is color-coded in light blue, referred to as 'QUALITY'. Following design development, there is a section for 'Construction Documents' that specifies the technical side of planning, followed immediately by 'Tender packages' which involves contracts and mobilizing processes.

The 'On Site' section follows this and is simply labeled as 'Construction', leading directly into the final phase labeled 'Postconstruction'. This last section includes further delineations: 'Udførelse', 'Aflevering', and 'Eftersyn', which translate to aspects such as execution, delivery, and review.

Throughout, arrows and connecting lines guide the flow from one phase to another, visually indicating progression. The overall structure emphasizes a clear pathway from conceptualization to construction and finally to postconstruction activities, highlighting the complexity and organization needed in project management.

{5}------------------------------------------------

# SHL process between Concept and Project design

Image /page/5/Figure/5 description: The image presents a flowchart illustrating the process involved in transitioning from Concept Design to Project Design phases in a construction or architectural context. The overall purpose is to provide a structured overview of the various stages and their corresponding tasks and responsibilities during the design and execution phases of a project.

At the top left, there is a large, light yellow rectangle labeled 'Concept Design.' This section includes two subdivisions: 'Prequalification' and 'Sketch / Competition,' indicating preliminary tasks required before detailed design work begins. 

Moving to the right, the chart expands into 'Project Design phases,' which consists of three major phases depicted in light blue rectangles: 'Schematic Design,' 'Detailed Development,' and 'Construction Documents.' Each of these phases is labeled with their respective contributions to the overall project, quantified as follows: 'Schematic Design' is assigned 20%, 'Detailed Development' is also 20%, 'Construction Documents' takes up 45%, and 'Construction Administration' accounts for 15%.

Between the phases, there are three specific tasks or milestones noted by letters A, B, and C, which detail contractor engagement strategies: 
- A refers to 'Early Contractor appointment - it is often a turnkey contractor (risk = quality),' 
- B signifies 'Appoint Contractor (risk = quality),' and
- C instructs to 'Appoint contractor after Tender (risk = pricing).' 

The lower part of the image contains a graph depicting the 'SHL Scope of Work,' which illustrates a downward slope labeled 'typical SHL/Architect of record Scope of work per phase' and is positioned below the project design phases. This graphical representation visually communicates the progressive reduction in scope as the project moves through its phases. 

The layout of the overall image is arranged horizontally from left to right, maintaining a systematic flow where each primary segment visually connects to the subsequent phases of the project, indicating a clear path from conceptualization to administration.

{6}------------------------------------------------

Image /page/6/Picture/2 description: The image displays a graphic logo featuring the name "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" prominently arranged in a bold, sans-serif typeface. The layout of the text is structured with each word stacked vertically. The first word, "SCHMIDT," appears at the top in a larger font size. Below it, "HAMMER" follows also in a large, bold typeface, with both words aligned to the left. The final word, "LASSEN," is placed beneath "HAMMER," maintaining the same left alignment and visual weight as the preceding words. The overall design is minimalist and emphasizes clarity through its strong, geometric lines and high contrast between the dark lettering and light background. The lack of additional text or visual elements focuses the viewer's attention solely on the architectural firm’s name, suggesting a modern and professional aesthetic in branding.

# **CONTRACT PREPARATION**

# **ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT METHOD**

# Quick overview

*• Which type of project is it? Key information - Impact on scope and project dynamics.*

*For example, often the client or contractor have an internal or external cost consultant in which we feed the architectural items. But in the scenario where the Architect has the Projekt ledelse in a Totalrådgiver scheme, we are responsible for the project economy.* 

*• Clarification of procurement method Turnkey contract? Tender*

Image /page/7/Picture/8 description: The image presents a diagram structured around a central concept labeled "PROJECT." Surrounding the central label are five distinct categories, each represented within dotted circles. The categories include "Client," "Authorities," "Suppliers," "Contractor," and "Advisors."

1. \*\*Central Element\*\*: In the middle of the diagram is a bold, large font labeled "PROJECT," indicating that this element is the focus of the visual.

2. \*\*Client Section\*\*: To the right of the central "PROJECT" label is the "Client" category. Inside this circle, various subtypes of clients are listed: "Private client," "pension fund," "State," "City," and "Developer," with some entries followed by ellipses, suggesting there may be additional examples or considerations.

3. \*\*Authorities Section\*\*: Positioned at the top left is the "Authorities" circle, indicating entities that may have regulatory or oversight roles relevant to the project, but no further details are provided within this section.

4. \*\*Suppliers Section\*\*: Located at the bottom left, the "Suppliers" circle signifies those who provide materials or services necessary for the project. There are no additional details visible in this section.

5. \*\*Contractor Section\*\*: Directly below the central "PROJECT" label sits the "Contractor" circle. This section includes the term "Subcontractors," indicating a potential hierarchy or network of contractors involved in the project, but again, no further information is provided here.

6. \*\*Advisors Section\*\*: On the top right of the diagram, the "Advisors" circle includes a list of professionals who may offer expertise to the project. The titles noted within this section are: "Architect," "Landscape arch," "Engineers," and "Interior architect," along with ellipses suggesting there could be more roles relevant to advisory positions.

Overall, the layout of the image is a circular flow, with the central focus being the "PROJECT,"
 and the surrounding categories connected visually to it. Each section is clearly delineated with its own labeled circle, creating an organized structure that highlights the relationships between the central project and its stakeholders or contributors.

### **Project organisation types:** (DK/EN)

Image /page/7/Figure/10 description: The image depicts an organizational chart or flowchart structured to illustrate the relationships among various parties involved in a design and build process. At the top, there is a rectangular box labeled "Client," indicating the primary party initiating the project. Directly connected to the "Client" is another box titled "Client advisor," suggesting a secondary party that provides assistance or advice to the client regarding the project.

Beneath the "Client" and "Client advisor" boxes is a larger rectangular box labeled "Design and build Contractor." This box includes a note stating "Design management," indicating that this entity is responsible for managing the design aspect of the project. 

From the "Design and build Contractor" box, three branches extend downward, leading to further subdivisions. On the left side, a box labeled "Architect" appears, signifying the role responsible for the architectural design of the project. Adjacent to the architect's box on the right is another labeled "Engineer," indicating the engineering responsibilities that also fall under this organizational flow.

Finally, the flow continues to a third category on the far right titled "Sub contractors," which points to additional entities that will be involved in the execution of various specialized tasks related to the project's construction.

The layout features a clear hierarchical structure, with the "Client" at the top, followed by subdivisions indicating the roles and responsibilities of different parties involved in the project. The overall flow is top to bottom, with boxes aligned vertically beneath their respective parent boxes.

Totalentreprise Design and Build

Image /page/7/Figure/12 description: The image displays an organizational chart titled "Design Management". At the top, there is a box labeled "Client" which is connected through lines to two other boxes: one labeled "Client advisor" on the right and the other with the main focus, "Design Management" in a green box, centered beneath the client. This green box connects vertically to a series of six other categories below it, which are organized in a single row. Each of these categories is housed within gray boxes. The categories listed are: "HVAC", "Plumbing", "Electricity", "core + shell", "Carpenter", "Paint", and "Interior". Below the chart, there is additional text reading ""Heavy load" for the Design Manager", suggesting the responsibilities and tasks attributed to the design manager within the outlined structure. The overall layout is systematic, with clear hierarchies and relationships between roles, effectively illustrating the components involved in design management as it relates to a client. The organization is clean, with clear alignment and flow from top to bottom.

Fagentreprise Tender in Subcontracts

Image /page/7/Picture/14 description: The image displays a structured organizational chart, which illustrates the relationships and hierarchy among various parties involved in a project, specifically in a construction or design context. At the top of the chart, there is a labeled box for 'Client,' indicating the primary stakeholder. To the right of the Client, another box labeled 'Client advisor' is positioned, suggesting the presence of an intermediary or consultant who provides guidance to the Client.

Below the 'Client' and to the left, there is a green box labeled 'Design Management,' which signifies a specialized area of oversight or coordination, possibly responsible for ensuring that the design aspect aligns with the Client's objectives.

Further down, beneath 'Design Management,' there is a larger box labeled 'General Contractor.' This box likely represents the entity responsible for the overall management and execution of the construction project. The image flows downward from 'Client' through 'Design Management' to the 'General Contractor,' indicating a clear organizational hierarchy.

Branching out from the 'General Contractor' are six boxes aligned in a row, each representing different roles or areas of work involved in the project. These boxes are labeled as follows: 'HVAC,' 'Plumbing,' 'Electricity,' 'core + shell,' 'Carpenter,' 'Paint,' and 'Interior.' Each of these categories signifies distinct specialized functions or groups that are essential to the project's successful completion. The layout of these rows features a clean horizontal alignment, indicating the equal importance of each category within the contractor's responsibilities. Overall, the image serves to effectively organize diverse components and roles within a construction design framework.

Hovedentreprise General Contractor

The term *"partnering"* is applied to a form of cooperation in a construction project that is based on dialogue, trust, openness and early involvement of all parties. The project is carried out under a common objective formulated by joint activities and based on common economic interests.

Partnering Joint venture

Image /page/7/Picture/18 description: The image presents an organizational chart illustrating a hierarchical structure related to a project, specifically focusing on 'Design Management.' At the top of the chart is a box labeled 'Client,' which is connected to another box labeled 'Client advisor' on the right side. Directly below the label 'Client' is a central box highlighted in green, titled 'Design Management.' This central box acts as a hub for three branches extending downward, each containing different contracts which are essential components of the project management framework. 

The first branch leads to 'Contract 1,' which specifies 'Plumbing HVAC.' This is positioned on the left side of the chart. Adjacent to this, in the middle, lies 'Contract 2,' with the label 'Core and shell' underscoring another aspect of the project. The final branch on the right side leads to 'Contract 3,' which details 'Interior Paint ceilings.' Additionally, there is a separate box labeled 'Electricity' positioned on the far right side, indicating another contractual obligation tied to the overall design management. 

The layout of the chart is organized in a top-down manner, where all components stem from the 'Client' box, creating a clear visual flow of how various contracts are managed and categorized under the 'Design Management' section. Each contract box is rectangular and contains specific terms denoting the work or areas of focus, providing clarity on the different responsibilities and divisions within the project's design management system.

### Storeentreprise Tender in large Contracts

(large contracts can vary)

OPP is an organizational form used to solve public works.

Thus, the private party is not only responsible for the construction, but also for sub- sequent maintenance and operational tasks. Therefore, the public party has a higher degree of functional requirements than execution requirements for the private party, which thus has more room for maneuver than in ordinary building and construction projects. The OPP supplier has to find out for himself how, it is ensured that a building gets the agreed func- tions and how it is subsequently operated and maintained. This provides a great incentive to devise long-term sustainable solutions and solve the task right from the start.

In an OPP project, among other things, financing, establishment and ongoing operations and maintenance are considered together in one and the same offering of a project. The significant investment is made by the private party, while the public party pays on an on- going basis for the task, which typically extends over a longer period - for example, 10-30 years.

A key challenge for OPPs is that both parties must become accustomed to some other roles than they are otherwise accustomed to. The public party must act as commissioner, and the private party must assume the developer role and seize the responsibility it entails.

# **INTERNAL HAND OVER WORKSHOP**

# Workshop knowledge sharing from competition phase

*SHL Transfer of knowledge between Concept phase and Design phase.* 

*What does SHL as a company see as an opportunity on this project?* 

*Ideally the workshop should take place when the PM and the PA of Schematic design phase are in place and will lead the workshop. If the team is already set up, it would be good they also attend the workshop.*

*It is important to write a summary of the workshop that will be saved in the server in the project folder.*

*Link to Summary template: https://perkinswillinc.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/SHLDenmarkOffice/ Shared%20Documents/General/Project%20Development/Templates/Handover%20Workshop%20Summary?csf=1&web=1&e=hmsCr5*

Image /page/8/Picture/10 description: The image displays a simple visual representation made up of circles arranged in two distinct sections. At the top of the image, there are two circles that overlap slightly. The left circle is colored yellow, while the right circle is colored blue. The area where the two circles intersect suggests a blending or combination of the two colors, visually indicating a relationship between them. Below these circles, there is a larger empty circle outlined in black, which is centered vertically underneath the overlapping circles. This larger circle is completely empty and has no color or markings inside it, clearly differentiating it from the upper circles. There is also a small vertical black line or connector at the center of the image, which emerges from the intersection of the circles at the top and extends downward into the larger circle at the bottom. The overall layout is vertical, with the two smaller overlapping circles positioned directly above the larger empty circle, creating a clear visual hierarchy. The lack of any additional labels, headings, or text makes the purpose of the image ambiguous, but it might imply a concept involving relationships or combinations.

*Video tutorials:* 

*https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/portfolio-item/pmtk-refresher/*

Image /page/9/Picture/8 description: The image depicts a simple illustration of a circular sign that is primarily colored yellow. The circle has a thin, black outline, giving it a defined boundary. Below the circle, there is a straight, narrow black pole that serves as the sign's base. There are no additional markings, labels, or text visible in the image other than the circular shape. The sign is placed against a plain white background, contributing to a minimalist aesthetic. This design is commonly used to indicate a range of meanings in various contexts such as traffic signs, informational signs, or markers. However, without any additional text or symbols, the specific purpose of this sign is not discernible from the visual alone.

### **Deliverables and responsabilities**

- Check the contract first. Often SHL needs to come up with a list of deliverables that will get approved by the contractor/client. In DK, it is on the client scope to specify what they want from YBL18.
- Involve SHL/PW digital team for the digital deliverables.
- Check or make the project organigram.
- Identify deliverables under SHL direct responsability or under a consultant/subconsultant responsability. Make sure to share the organigram and deliverables and responsabilities list with all collaborators.

Image /page/9/Picture/14 description: The image prominently features the text "SHL Planning" displayed in a clear and elegant typeface. The words are arranged horizontally, with a notable emphasis on the term "SHL" which appears bolder or larger than the word "Planning," suggesting that it may be the main focus or title of the document. The overall layout is simple yet effective, conveying professionalism and clarity. The text is likely centered in the space, creating a balanced visual effect. There are no additional images or graphical elements present in the image, ensuring that the attention remains solely on the textual content. The design choice may indicate a corporate or organizational context, likely related to strategic planning or project management.

- 1. Timeframe + deliverables-responsibilities + other relevant info: Extract relevant info for SHL workflow.
- 2. Elaborate a **timeschedule with milestones** including:
  - **• Deadlines** for deliverables
  - Recurrent meetings or workshops, user engagement sessions, planning process
  - Specific **design tasks.** Add an estimate timing to them.
  - Include the **Quality Assurance plan** milestones. Plan it with the QA manager according to the SHL Quality Assurance Standard.
  - Plan other SHL internal milestones, such as Digital team, Sustainability, Peer Review, etc.
- 3.Involve the partner in charge. When approved, share with team internally and if relevant also externally.

Image /page/9/Picture/23 description: The image features a diagram consisting of two overlapping circles, which is a visual representation often used to convey concepts in Venn diagrams. The left circle is filled with a solid gray color, while the right circle is completely white and unfilled. There is a vertical line positioned beneath the two circles, extending downward, which terminates in a square shape at the bottom. This configuration indicates a division between the circles and suggests an underlying connection or categorization, often used in contexts such as logic, probability, or set theory, where the overlap represents shared attributes or commonalities between the two entities. The left circle's solid gray color may denote a specific category or group, whereas the white circle could represent another category, with the overlap potentially indicating shared characteristics or a point of intersection between the two groups. No additional text or labels are visible in the image, leaving the interpretation reliant on the visual structure alone.

### **Staffing**

Phase fee + Planning are the base for the project staffing.

Discuss with Partner in charge/ Finance/Operations director and agree on skills and FTE required for project.

Image /page/9/Picture/27 description: The image consists of a simple black-and-white graphic depicting a circle with a small solid rectangle underneath it, forming a symbol that can represent a variety of ideas or concepts. The circle is a filled black shape, creating a stark contrast against the white background. Beneath the circle, there is a smaller black rectangle, centered directly below the circle. This layout creates a vertical alignment where the circle appears at the top and the rectangle directly supports it, giving a sense of balance and simplicity. The overall visual may represent concepts such as 'gender', 'female', or other symbolic meanings in various contexts, but no specific label or text is present in the image to provide further clarification on its intended purpose. The design is minimalist, with no additional elements, shading, or intricate details, allowing the viewer to focus solely on the shape and its potential interpretations.

# Living Design - Sustainability process

### **LIVING DESIGN**

Living Design enables architects to maintain design authority while accessing specialised knowledge across environmental performance, lifecycle assessment, social shifts and regulatory compliance.

Our sustainability and Innovation group provides project teams with the technical capacity and cross-disciplinary coordination tools necessary to deliver a unified sustainability and design vision, even when confronted with conflicting aims from stakeholders and consultants.

The service operates through structured meetings, workshops, systematic tracking tools, including our proprietary Palette platform—featuring practice cards that provide gateway access to extensive technical knowledge across sustainability topics from P&W and select external experts. This approach ensures that the

design intent established during concept phases remains coherent through project development, while enabling architects to confidently engage with clients, engineers, consultants, and specialist disciplines.

Q:\Denmark\Archive\SHL Design\\_SUS-TAINABILITY\HJC\Presentations\241004\_ PA PM Presentation.pptx

### **PROCESS INTEGRATION**

Living Design transforms sustainability from a parallel workstream into an integrated design methodology, enabling architects to deliver projects that achieve both design excellence and measurable environmental performance.

We integrate with standard project phases in five primary ways:

- **Living Design Handover Meetings**  bridge concept to detailed design phases, assessing project aspirations, constraints, opportunities, and focus areas to maintain relevant sustainability drivers.
- **Topic-based Workshops** at schematic design ensure design intent continuity. Further workshops address specific areas like comfort analysis, circularity mapping, or lifecycle assessment.
- **Palette Platform Integration** offers practice cards on sustainability topics, connecting teams to up-to-date research, how-to-guides and technical knowledge across the broader firm without compromising project momentum or design authority.
- **Focused research**: Projects often require a specific deep dive into particular sustainability topics to preserve design

intent. This could be due to a misalignment with stakeholders and consultants, or because of a knowledge shortfall.

### - **Sustainability scope deliverables**:

There is often extra project scope that is best handled by SHL rather than external consultants. We have a long list of services normally taken by specialists that can be performed in-house, giving architects a closer relationship with the analysis that influences design decisions

Living Design scales with project complexity. It provides tracking of design drivers and communication tools while offering specialist services such as environmental simulations and circular economy strategies for projects in progress.

# Working environment

### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

**P:Drive :** for modelling, graphics and deliverables. Permanent archiving of deliverables (except BIM models), correspondence and legal documents.

P:Drive Folder structure can be found here: P:\Denmark\SHL\_Project\_Folder\_ Master

### 2. Sharing externally.

Some clients want a specific platform for sharing files and documents, such as Dalux, Byggeweb, iBinder, DROPS etc. In each project, the archiving strategy of the documents in these platforms needs to be agreed separately with the Digital team.

If there is not such a system established, **Sharepoint** should be used as sharing platform with external parties. Reach out to the Digital team to establish the folders and permissions.

*We-transfer, mail attachments or screenshots in e-mails are NOT valid methods of sharing information with external parties.*

### 3. BIM environment.

**BIM 360** is the working environment for Revit files and all associated files. If by contract you need to use a different platform, please contact the Digital team before agreeing to it.

Image /page/19/Figure/18 description: The image displays a user interface for a document management system, specifically focusing on permission levels for accessing documents. On the left side, there is a section titled 'Permission Level' with various levels of access outlined. The first level is 'View Only,' which states, "Can view documents and can add markups/issues, but cannot upload or download content." Below that is 'View+Download,' which states, "Can view and download documents and can add markups/issues, but cannot upload content." The next level is 'Upload Only,' allowing users to "upload content, but cannot view folder contents." Following that is the level 'View+Download+Upload,' which states, "Can upload, download and view content, and add markups/issues." Lastly, 'View+Download+Upload+Edit' is detailed, explaining that one can "review and publish content, as well as edit and delete folder/subfolder content." The final option, 'Folder Control,' gives "full administrative controls, including managing folder access and title blocks." 

To the right of the permission levels is a navigation section titled 'Document Manager,' where users can view documents. Below this section, there is a layout titled 'Projects Files' that lists different categories, including 'ARCH - PW,' 'CIVIL - \_ADD COMPANY NAME,' 'ELEC - \_ADD COMPANY NAME,' 'LAND - \_ADD COMPANY NAME,' 'MECH - \_ADD COMPANY NAME,' 'PLUM - \_ADD COMPANY NAME,' and 'STRU - \_ADD COMPANY NAME.' These categories are likely subfolders within the project files, indicating clear organization by discipline or function. The overall layout organizes the permissions clearly into a list format, while the project files are displayed in a tree structure with expandable folders, allowing for easy navigation. The interface appears to be intuitive, with elements arranged vertically and hierarchically to facilitate user accessibility and understanding.

{20}------------------------------------------------

# Archiving a project phase

### **Project Archiving process for the end of each phase**

*It is extremely important to archive each phase in the P: Drive, under Project / 09 Phase submission.*

*There should be a folder for each phase, in which there should be:*

- *final delivered material (in all formats delivered to the client, including the BIM models)*
- *handover notes or stage report*
- *phase evaluation*

*If the project is kept only in Sharepoint, the same documentation should be saved here:*

Image /page/20/Picture/12 description: The image presents a flowchart or organizational diagram centered around the concept of 'Deliverables.' At the top of the flowchart is a rectangular label stating 'Deliverables' in bold, uppercase letters, indicating that this is the main subject of the diagram. Below this, a vertical line connects the 'Deliverables' label to a new rectangular box that contains the text 'Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name.' This label appears to represent a specific deliverable identified by a date format (year-month-day) followed by an underscore and an issue name, suggesting a systematic way to categorize issues by date. 

Beneath this box, the diagram features two additional rectangular sections stacked vertically. The first of these sections is labeled 'Handover,' while the second is labeled 'Evaluation.' These labels imply sequential steps in a process following the identification of the deliverable mentioned above. 

The overall layout of the diagram is organized in a clear, top-down format, with each subsequent component flowing from the one above it. The use of distinct rectangular boxes and a clean vertical arrangement emphasizes the hierarchical relationship among the elements. The color scheme appears to be a shade of teal for the boxes, which may contribute to a professional appearance, while the structure allows for easy comprehension of the relationships between different deliverables and their associated processes.

Image /page/20/Picture/13 description: The image displays a file explorer window from a computer, organized to show the directory structure for a specific project. It is situated under the main sections labeled 'This PC,' 'Projects (P:),' 'Denmark,' '2024,' '682407 Kronos Luxembourg,' and '02 Project.' 

The layout of the window comprises a list format with visible columns that include 'Name,' 'Date modified,' 'Type,' and 'Size.' The 'Name' column prominently displays various folder names designated for specific project components. Notable folders include '01 Concept Design,' '02 Areas,' '02 Document List,' '03 Models,' '04 Sketches,' '05 Presentations,' '06 Specifications,' '07 File Exchange,' '08 Sustainability,' '09 Phase Submissions,' '10 Current Drawings,' and '11 DALUX ARCHIVE.' 

Each folder name is aligned left within the 'Name' column, indicating they are file folders. The dates in the adjacent 'Date modified' column denote the last modified date and time for each folder, with different formats, primarily exhibiting day-month-year and time, such as '29-07-2024 12:08' for '01 Concept Design' and '12-05-2025 11:18' for '09 Phase Submissions.' The 'Type' column lists all entries uniformly as 'File folder,' and the 'Size' column is noted but displays no specific numerical data next to these entries, suggesting a standard uniformity for folders. 

The '09 Phase Submissions' folder is highlighted in red, indicating its significance or current relevance within the project. Each folder name is arranged in a single vertical column, creating a clear, straightforward flow from the top of the list downwards, facilitating easy navigation. The overall visual demonstrates organized project management, allowing users to access various stages and components of the '682407 Kronos Luxembourg' project efficiently.

### **E-mail archiving:**

*At the beginning of the project ideally, ask IT to cre ate a shared mailbox for the project and provide them with the list of users needing access to it. This address should be put in copy of all project corre spondence.*

*If this address was never created, ask IT to do it. In any case, when a phase is over, e-mails should be archived there by dragging them directly to it. This should be explained in the phase Handover notes (see SHL Templates / Other useful tools in this document).*

*If nothing works, Outlook classic allows to convert mail folders into an indexed Adobe PDF docu ment.*

{21}------------------------------------------------

The overall purpose of the visual is to represent the branding or identity of a company or organization, likely related to architecture or design, given the names used.

## **CONSTRUCTION ADMINISTRATION** SHL process

### **GENERAL DESIGN PROCESS**

Manufacturing, construction and commissioning completed at the end of the phase. Design work is only Site Queries as required.

It is very important to run them by the Quality Assurance plan, especially if new details or solutions are put forward by the contractor and so on.

### • Core tasks:

Finalise Site Logistics Manufacture Building Systems and construct building Monitor progress against Construction Programme Inspect Construction Quality Resolve Site Queries as required Undertake Commissioning of building Prepare Building Manual

### • Other processes:

carry out Construction Phase Plan Comply with Planning Conditions related to construction

Image /page/29/Figure/11 description: The image is a flowchart outlining the stages of a construction project. The visual is organized in a circular format with arrows indicating the progression through various phases. At the top right, the flow begins with the label '01. Go IN', indicating the initial stage where actions such as finalizing site logistics and manufacturing building systems take place. Following this, '02. Go OUT' signifies the commencement of on-site construction, which includes monitoring progress against the construction program and conducting site supervision. This is followed by '03. Go DEEP', where site queries are addressed, and quality assurance processes are implemented. The next stage is labeled '04. Go HIGH', which suggests an overarching phase focused on the project’s overall execution and inspection. The flow culminates with '05. Go OUT', leading to the 'Handover of building', transitioning the project towards completion. Additional labels indicate actions such as the contractor appointment, SHL staffing/planning, and activities related to knowledge sharing and evaluations. There are key indicators that highlight main milestones and processes dependent on the particulars of the project. The layout features a mix of vertical and horizontal alignment with distinct sections dedicated to various construction activities and checkpoints, all enclosed within a circular structure to reflect the continuous nature of project management.
