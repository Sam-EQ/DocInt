**[Image from page 3]:** The image features a logo consisting of the words "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" arranged in a stacked format. The text is written in a bold sans-serif font, with the name divided into three lines. The overall design has a modern and minimalistic aesthetic, with the words presented in a solid black color against a light grey background.

**[Image from page 3]:** The image is a comparative overview titled "INTERNATIONAL WORK STAGES OVERVIEW" that outlines various stages involved in architectural projects across different countries. The information is organized into columns representing different countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, USA, UK, Germany, Luxembourg/France, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. Each country has distinct stages listed under four main categories: Preparation, Design Proposal, Production, On Site, and Post Construction. Numerous stages are specified with numerical indicators, signifying their sequence, such as "1" to "9" in some categories, illustrating a structured workflow in project management. For example, Denmark lists stages from "1 Idéoplæg" to "9 Eftersyn", while the UK uses RIBA stages from "Stage 0 Strategic definition" to "Stage 7 In Use". The information is laid out in a clear format, making it easy to compare processes across different regions.

**[Image from page 4]:** The image features the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" presented in a bold, modern sans-serif font. The words are stacked vertically, creating a visually impactful arrangement. The text is in black against a light gray background.

**[Image from page 4]:** The image presents a project development diagram divided into several phases labeled as preparation, design proposal, production, on site, and postconstruction. It compares project phases in Denmark and the USA. The left section lists phases in Denmark, starting with 'Ideoplæg' (Preparation) and ending with 'Eftesyn' (Postconstruction). The phases for the USA follow similarly, from 'Schematic Design' to 'Construction Administration.' The main sections are organized into columns, with tasks such as 'Concept Design' and 'Project Design' prominently displayed. Under 'Project Design,' there is a highlighted 'DESIGN PHASE' and sections like 'Schematic Design' and 'Design Development,' emphasizing quantity and quality respectively. Multiple diamonds indicate key decision points where client approvals and approvals for the final design occur. Additionally, there are notes about tender packages, construction commencement, and postconstruction inspections.

#### SHL process between Concept and Project design

**[Image from page 5]:** The diagram illustrates the process between concept and project design in architecture. It is divided into two main sections: 'Concept Design' and 'Project Design Phases.' The 'Concept Design' section includes 'Prequalification' and 'Sketch/Competition.' Below this section, it lists 'Contract preparation' steps that involve 'Clarification of Procurement method' and 'Planning, Staffing, Team setup.'

The 'Project Design Phases' section is split into three areas: 'Schematic Design,' 'Detailed Development,' and 'Construction Documents,' with percentages indicating the workload for each phase: 20% for both Schematic Design and Detailed Development, 45% for Construction Documents, and 15% for 'Construction Administration.' Under each phase, there are specific notes: A mentions 'Early Contractor appointment,' B discusses 'Appoint Contractor,' and C states 'Appoint contractor after Tender.' At the bottom of the diagram, there’s a graph indicating the typical SHL/Architect of Record Scope of Work per phase, showing a decreasing slope labeled 'A.O.R.' The overall layout is clear and organized with labeled sections and accompanying details.

**[Image from page 6]:** The image features bold, uppercase text displaying the name "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN". The letters are thick and evenly spaced, creating a modern and minimalist aesthetic. The background is a light gray, which contrasts with the black text, making it visually striking.

### **CONTRACT PREPARATION**

#### Overview and references

Ideally the contract should be ready before Schematic Design phase starts.

If the contract signing is delayed or under works when SD starts, it is **necessary** to establish a payment plan until the contract is in place.

#### ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT METHOD

#### Quick overview

- Which type of project is it? Key information - Impact on scope and project dynamics.

For example, often the client or contractor have an internal or external cost consultant in which we feed the architectural items.

But in the scenario where the Architect has the Projekt ledelse in a Totalrådgiver scheme, we are responsible for the project economy.

- Clarification of **procurement method** Turnkey contract? Tender

**[Image from page 7]:** The image presents a diagram labeled "PROJECT" at the center, surrounded by five circles representing various stakeholders. These circles include: 1. "Client" (with examples like private client pension fund, state, city, developer), 2. "Authorities", 3. "Advisors" (including architects, landscape architects, engineers, and interior architects), 4. "Contractor" (noting subcontractors), and 5. "Suppliers". Each stakeholder is indicated with dashed circular outlines.

#### **Project organisation types:**
##### (DK/EN)

**[Image from page 7]:** The diagram illustrates the organizational structure of a construction project. At the top is the 'Client,' who has a connection to a 'Client advisor.' Below, there's a 'Design and build Contractor' responsible for 'Design management.' The contractor branches into three positions: 'Architect,' 'Engineer,' and 'Sub contractors.' The 'Architect' is on the left, represented in green, while the 'Engineer' and 'Sub contractors' are positioned to the right.

Totalentreprise Design and Build

**[Image from page 7]:** The image presents a flowchart illustrating the structure of a design management process. At the top, labeled 'Client,' there is a line connecting to 'Client advisor.' Beneath 'Client,' the central box 'Design Management' is highlighted in green and connected to six subcategories arranged in two rows. The first row includes 'HVAC,' 'Plumbing,' 'Electricity,' and 'core + shell.' The second row includes 'Carpenter,' 'Paint,' and 'Interior.' At the bottom, there's a note stating "Heavy load for the Design Manager."

Fagentreprise Tender in Subcontracts

**[Image from page 7]:** The image is an organizational chart related to a design management structure. At the top, there is a 'Client' and a 'Client advisor' branch. Below that, there is a central box labeled 'Design Management' in green. Below the 'Design Management' section, there is 'General Contractor,' which branches out into five categories: 'HVAC,' 'Plumbing,' 'Electricity,' 'core + shell,' 'Carpenter,' 'Paint,' and 'Interior.' Each category is represented in a rectangular box beneath 'General Contractor.'

Hovedentreprise General Contractor

The term "partnering" is applied to a form of cooperation in a construction project that is based on dialogue, trust, openness and early involvement of all parties. The project is carried out under a common objective formulated by joint activities and based on common economic interests.

Partnering Joint venture

**[Image from page 7]:** The image presents an organizational chart related to design management. At the top, there is a box labeled "Client" connected to a "Client advisor" box on the right. Below the "Client" box is a central box labeled "Design Management" in green. This central box branches out into three contracts: "Contract 1" for Plumbing and HVAC, "Contract 2" for Core and shell, and "Contract 3" for Interior Paint ceilings. On the far right, there is a box labeled "Electricity." The structure emphasizes the relationships between the client, the advisory role, and various design management contracts.

## Storeentreprise Tender in large Contracts

(large contracts can vary)

OPP is an organizational form used to solve public works

### The essence of OPP is that the public finds a private supplier to not only carry out a construction project but also to run the construction.

quent maintenance and operational tasks. Therefore, the public party has a higher degree of functional requirements than execution requirements for the private party, which thus has more room for maneuver than in ordinary building and construction projects. The OPP supplier has to find out for himself how, it is ensured that a building gets the agreed functions and how it is subsequently operated and maintained. This provides a great incentive to devise long-term sustainable solutions and solve the task right from the start. In an OPP project, among other things, financing, establishment and ongoing operations and maintenance are considered together in one and the same offering of a project. The significant investment is made by the private party, while the public party pays on an ongoing basis for the task, which typically extends over a longer period - for example. 10-30 years.

A key challenge for OPPs is that both parties must become accustomed to some other roles than they are otherwise accustomed to. The public party must act as commissioner, and the private party must assume the developer role and seize the responsibility it entails

#### INTERNAL HAND OVER WORKSHOP

#### Workshop knowledge sharing from competition phase

SHL Transfer of knowledge between Concept phase and Design phase.

What does SHL as a company see as an opportunity on this project?

Ideally the workshop should take place when the PM and the PA of Schematic design phase are in place and will lead the workshop.

If the team is already set up, it would be good they also attend the workshop.

It is important to write a summary of the workshop that will be saved in the server in the project folder.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image features a simple, solid yellow circle outlined in black. The circle is displayed vertically on a white background, resembling a stop or caution signal.

### Deliverables and responsibilities

- Check the contract first. Often SHL needs to come up with a list of deliverables that will get approved by the contractor/client. In DK, it is on the client scope to specify what they want from YBL18.
- Involve SHL/PW digital team for the digital deliverables.
- Check or make the project organization chart.
- Identify deliverables under SHL direct responsibility or under a consultant/subconsultant responsibility. Make sure to share the organization chart and deliverables and responsibilities list with all collaborators.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image features bold text that reads "SHL Planning". The font is a serif style, giving it a formal appearance. The letters are predominantly black against a light background, emphasizing the clarity and importance of the text. The structure suggests it is likely a title or heading for a document or presentation related to planning.

- 1. Timeframe + deliverables-responsibilities + other relevant info: Extract relevant info for SHL workflow.
- 2. Elaborate a **timeschedule with milestones** including:
  - **Deadlines** for deliverables
  - Recurrent meetings or workshops, user engagement sessions, planning process
  - Specific **design tasks**. Add an estimate timing to them.
  - Include the **Quality Assurance plan** milestones. Plan it with the QA manager according to the SHL Quality Assurance Standard.
  - Plan other SHL internal milestones, such as Digital team, Sustainability, Peer Review, etc.
- 3. Involve the partner in charge. When approved, share with team internally and if relevant also externally.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image consists of two overlapping circles, one of which is shaded in gray and the other is outlined in black without shading, creating a Venn diagram effect. Below the circles, there is a vertical dashed line, indicating a connection or reference point. The circles symbolize different sets or categories, with the overlap suggesting a shared element between them.

#### Staffing

Phase fee + Planning are the base for the project staffing.

Discuss with Partner in charge/Finance/Operations director and agree on skills and FTE required for project.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image features a black, circular outline positioned above a rectangular base. The circular part is centered, and there is a small square at the bottom center of the circle, creating a symmetrical appearance. This design resembles a stylized icon or symbol.

#### Living Design - Sustainability process

#### **LIVING DESIGN**

Living Design enables architects to maintain design authority while accessing specialised knowledge across environmental performance, lifecycle assessment, social shifts and regulatory compliance.

Our sustainability and Innovation group provides project teams with the technical capacity and cross-disciplinary coordination tools necessary to deliver a unified sustainability and design vision, even when confronted with conflicting aims from stakeholders and consultants.

The service operates through structured meetings, workshops, systematic tracking tools, including our proprietary Palette platform—featuring practice cards that provide gateway access to extensive technical knowledge across sustainability topics from P&W and select external experts. This approach ensures that the

design intent established during concept phases remains coherent through project development, while enabling architects to confidently engage with clients, engineers, consultants, and specialist disciplines.

Q:\Denmark\Archive\SHL Design\ SUS-TAINABILITY\HJC\Presentations\241004 PA PM Presentation.pptx

#### **PROCESS INTEGRATION**

Living Design transforms sustainability from a parallel workstream into an integrated design methodology, enabling architects to deliver projects that achieve both design excellence and measurable environmental performance.

We integrate with standard project phases in five primary ways:

- Living Design Handover Meetings
  bridge concept to detailed design phases, assessing project aspirations, constraints, opportunities, and focus areas to maintain relevant sustainability drivers.
- Topic-based Workshops at schematic design ensure design intent continuity. Further workshops address specific areas like comfort analysis, circularity mapping, or lifecycle assessment.
- Palette Platform Integration offers practice cards on sustainability topics, connecting teams to up-to-date research, how-to-guides and technical knowledge across the broader firm without compromising project momentum or design authority.
- **Focused research**: Projects often require a specific deep dive into particular sustainability topics to preserve design

intent. This could be due to a misalignment with stakeholders and consultants, or because of a knowledge shortfall.

#### - Sustainability scope deliverables:

There is often extra project scope that is best handled by SHL rather than external consultants. We have a long list of services normally taken by specialists that can be performed in-house, giving architects a closer relationship with the analysis that influences design decisions.

Living Design scales with project complexity. It provides tracking of design drivers and communication tools while offering specialist services such as environmental simulations and circular economy strategies for projects in progress.

## Working environment

### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

Currently a new system complying with the new ISO regulation is being developed.

In the meantime, the current system to be used works as follows:

#### 1. Working internally.

Check first if by contract, for internal work, a certain working platform, folder structure (ISO compliance, others) and/or file sharing system needs to be used in the project.

**Sharepoint.** Projects with other P&W offices need to happen in Sharepoint, where access can be controlled and authorship tracked.

The folder structure should follow the PW folder structure, implemented by the SHL Digital team in Copenhagen shown in this slide.

Sharepoint P&W presentation: [https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/port-folio-item/core-exchange-sharepoint-teams-q12024/](https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/port-folio-item/core-exchange-sharepoint-teams-q12024/)

Folder Deliverables

Project files will be stored in 3 distinct locations:

- Modeling, graphics and presentation files, permanent storage of deliverables (except BIM models)
- Deliverables (for transfer outside the design team)
- Design Team (for SHL and our consultants)
- SHL Team (for SHL only)

BIM360

Revit, and associated, files

**[Image from page 18]:** The image displays a flowchart labeled "Deliverables" at the top, connected vertically to three components below. The first component is titled "Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name," representing a format for naming issues. Below this, there are two additional boxes labeled "Handover" and "Evaluation." These components are aligned in a vertical manner, with all boxes enclosed in rounded rectangles and shaded in a light green color.

**[Image from page 18]:** This diagram outlines the structure of a "Design Team". At the top, the heading "Folder Design Team" indicates that this folder is shared with consultants under direct contracts with SHL. Beneath this, there is a main node labeled "Design Team" which branches out into four categories: "01-Predesign Programming", "02-PlanningDesign", "03-Presentations", and "04-LivingDesign". Each category contains specific items or topics.

Under "01-Predesign Programming", the bullet points include:
- CodeAnalysis
- ExistingConditions-Surveys
- FFE-Inventories
- GeotechnicalReports
- RoomDataSheets
- SpaceProgramming

Under "02-PlanningDesign", the bullet points are:
- DrawingSheetLog
- MasterPlanStudies
- Report Originals

Under "03-Presentations", there is a placeholder indicated as "yyyy-mm-dd\_Presentation\_Name" for organizing presentation files.

Lastly, under "04-LivingDesign", the bullet points list:
- Energy-Atmosphere
- Health-Equity
- Material-Product
- Site-Water.

**[Image from page 18]:** The image depicts a flowchart titled "Folder SHL Team" with the note "*For Internal SHL use only!" at the top. The chart is divided into four main sections branching from the central node labeled "SHL Team." The first section is "01-ProjectMgmnt," which lists several components: Billing, ConsultantAgreements, CostManagement, DigitalExecutionPlan, ClientAgreements, and Schedules. The second section is "02-ClientCorresp," which contains only one item: MeetingDocs. The third section is "03-ContractorCorresp," which has no listed items. The fourth section is "04-Specifications," which includes three items: Archive, CurrentWordFiles, and MaterialResearch. Each section and item is enclosed within red boxes, and the overall structure resembles a hierarchical chart.

#### Working environment

#### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

**P:Drive:** for modelling, graphics and deliverables. Permanent archiving of deliverables (except BIM models), correspondence and legal documents.

P:Drive Folder structure can be found here: P:\Denmark\SHL Project Folder

Master

#### 2. Sharing externally.

Some clients want a specific platform for sharing files and documents, such as Dalux, Byggeweb, iBinder, DROPS etc. In each project, the archiving strategy of the documents in these platforms needs to be agreed separately with the Digital team.

If there is not such a system established, **Sharepoint** should be used as sharing platform with external parties. Reach out to the Digital team to establish the folders and permissions.

We-transfer, mail attachments or screen-shots in e-mails are NOT valid methods of sharing information with external parties.

#### 3. BIM environment.

**BIM 360** is the working environment for Revit files and all associated files. If by contract you need to use a different platform, please contact the Digital team before agreeing to it.

#### Folder structure and Permissions

- Each company or team will receive a folder which they alone can edit
- All consultants will have the ability to view, download and link to any file in the project.
- Perkins&Will does not allow for external team members to be project admins; <u>however</u> we grant full control to your company folder to allow for the adding and removal of team members to that company folder.

**[Image from page 19]:** The image displays a section of a document management system, focusing on permission levels for accessing content. It shows a list of permission types with descriptive texts indicating the capabilities associated with each level. The permission levels include: 'View Only' (can view documents and add markups/issues), 'View + Download' (can view and download documents but cannot upload), 'Upload Only' (can upload content but cannot view folders), 'View + Download + Upload' (can upload, download, and view content as well as add markups/issues), and 'View + Download + Upload + Edit' (can review, publish, edit, and delete content in folders/subfolders). Additionally, there is a 'Folder Control' option that offers full administrative capabilities. On the sidebar, there is a directory labeled 'Project Files' which includes subfolders named 'ARCH - PW', 'CIVIL - _ADD COMPANY NAME', 'ELEC - _ADD COMPANY NAME', 'LAND - _ADD COMPANY NAME', 'MECH - _ADD COMPANY NAME', 'PLUM - _ADD COMPANY NAME', and 'STRU - _ADD COMPANY NAME'.

#### Archiving a project phase

#### Project Archiving process for the end of each phase

It is extremely important to archive each phase in the P: Drive, under Project / 09 Phase submission.

There should be a folder for each phase, in which there should be:

- final delivered material (in all formats delivered to the client, including the BIM models)
- handover notes or stage report
- phase evaluation

If the project is kept only in Sharepoint, the same documentation should be saved here:

**[Image from page 20]:** The image is a flowchart titled "Deliverables". At the top, there is a rectangular box labeled "Deliverables" with an arrow pointing downward. Below it, there is another rectangular box labeled "Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name". Below this box, there are two additional rectangular boxes stacked vertically. The first is labeled "Handover" and the second is labeled "Evaluation".

**[Image from page 20]:** The image displays a directory structure on a computer showing various project folders. The top-level directory is labeled "This PC" followed by "Projects (P:)" and then "Denmark". Under that, there are multiple subfolders associated with a project for "682407 Kronos Luxembourg", specifically the "02 Project". The folders are listed in order with their respective modification dates and sizes, with a specific emphasis on the folder labeled "09 Phase Submissions" highlighted in red. Other folders include "01 Concept Design", "02 Areas", "03 Models", and several more, with modification dates ranging from 2024 to 2025.

#### E-mail archiving:

At the beginning of the project ideally, ask IT to create a shared mailbox for the project and provide them with the list of users needing access to it. This address should be put in copy of all project correspondence.

If this address was never created, ask IT to do it. In any case, when a phase is over, e-mails should be archived there by dragging them directly to it. This should be explained in the phase Handover notes (see SHL Templates / Other useful tools in this document).

If nothing works, Outlook classic allows to convert mail folders into an indexed Adobe PDF document.

**[Image from page 21]:** The image features the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" prominently displayed in bold, capital letters. The font is sans-serif and modern, giving a clean aesthetic. The text is centered on a light grey background, emphasizing the stark contrast and readability of the design. There are no additional images or graphics present in the composition.

#### Sharing in Project Hub

**[Image from page 21]:** The image features a structured flowchart related to a project deliverables process. On the left side, it includes a green box labeled "Deliverables" connecting down to a blue box that specifies naming conventions: "Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name." Below this, there are two additional green boxes labeled "Handover" and "Evaluation." On the right side, the flowchart connects to a visual display of project information for the MMU Library Transformation project by Hawkins Brown Architects. This includes details such as the project name, location in Manchester, UK, a brief description, basic details, and links for accessing different project stages. A map of the project location is displayed with relevant facts about the project type and budget displayed below. A dotted line encircles this project information section, emphasizing its significance in relation to the deliverables.

**[Image from page 21]:** The image features a simple white outline graphic on a blue background. The graphic represents a location pin superimposed on a map icon, suggesting the concept of location or navigation. The design is minimalistic, with clear and straightforward lines, making it easily recognizable.

Project Map

**[Image from page 21]:** The image is a world map marked with circles representing various data points. Each circle is color-coded in blue and varies in size based on numerical values indicated inside them. The numbers displayed within the circles range from 4 to 27,000. The circles are scattered across different continents, with notable groupings in North America, Europe, and Asia. Some specific values from the circles include '54' in Alaska, '13k' in the United States, '567' in China, and '900' in Brazil. Additionally, there is an orange circle, which appears in the South Pacific Ocean, but has no numeric value indicated. The map includes geographic labels such as 'North Pacific Ocean' and 'South Pacific Ocean' and is titled 'Project Map' at the top.

At the end of each phase, the PA should add a link to the Deliverables folder in the P: Drive into the Project Hub.

This is an important step of a process to improve knowledge-sharing across the project teams in the office.

### SCHMIDT HAMMER LAGGEN

#### A CONTINUOUS PROCESS

One circle leading into another

**[Image from page 22]:** The image illustrates a circular diagram with concentric circles labeled with specific terms. At the center is the word "Concept," surrounded by four additional layers. The first layer, immediately surrounding the concept, is labeled "SD," followed by the layer labeled "DD," then "CD," and the outermost layer labeled "CA." The circles are represented with varying line styles, suggesting a hierarchy or relationship between the terms. An arrow at the top points towards the word "Concept." The overall design highlights the structure of the concepts and their degrees of separation.

### CIRCLE OF INNOVATION SHL Concept methodology - Phases

**[Image from page 22]:** The image presents a circular flowchart illustrating a five-step process titled 'Analyse, Explore, Produce, Communicate.' Each step is represented in a different color, with directional arrows indicating the flow from one step to the next. The steps are: 01. Go In (Analyse) with subpoints including 'Get involved, Client understanding, Assignment understanding, Planning, Problem & fact finding, All is relevant'; 02. Go Wide (Explore) with subpoints 'Explore the limits, Get the big picture, Multiple concepts, Generate ideas, Green mapping, Identity and values'; 03. Go Deep (Produce) with subpoints 'Action, Refine, Communicate, Lift the Game, Production, Implement'; 04. Go High (Communicate); and 05. Go Out. The design features a light background with pastel colors for each section.

**[Image from page 22]:** The image displays the number '03' prominently at the top left in a large, light purple font. Below it, the word 'DEVELOP' is featured in bold, capital letters in a larger size, also in light purple. To the right of 'DEVELOP,' there are four smaller phrases arranged vertically: 'Evaluate,' 'Focus,' 'Development of concept,' and 'Optimize.' These phrases are presented in a lighter shade of purple, maintaining a clean and minimalist design against a white background.

**[Image from page 23]:** The image features the logo of an architectural firm laid out in bold, uppercase letters. The words "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" are stacked vertically, with each name on a separate line. The font is modern and sans-serif, with a clean and minimalist design that emphasizes simplicity and professionalism. The background is light grey, providing contrast to the black text.

#### SCHEMATIC DESIGN

#### SHL process

#### **GENERAL DESIGN PROCESS**

Main decisions on location, extent and delimitation of the building (area, height, volume, constraints) are taken. Principle overall strategies are set.

- Beginning of stage: Client to confirm or update Concept design assumptions
- End of stage: Project Brief is frozen
- Architectural Design.

Refinement of architectural idea.

Assessment and prioritization of alternative solutions.

Feed into Overall cost estimate.

Drawing scale 1:500-1:200

Determination of:

- Division of building into different areas.
- Location of all functions and rooms
- Building outline and Massing
- Module Grids, Overall grid
- Levels
- Core
- Facade principle
- Area schedule
- Description of surfaces and materials for quality/budget decision-making

•••

- Consultants, set up:

... other relevant disciplines

#### PARALLEL PROCESSES TO CONSIDER

**Planning authorities:** the timing varies from country and project. Often an Impact assessment is required early on for the authorities to approve.

**User Engagement:** clarification of potential user processes early on. If public or civic project it can be a substantial workload, in person meetings where users provide input into the project brief.

**[Image from page 23]:** This diagram illustrates a project management workflow with a circular flow, indicating various stages of a process. The process starts with 'Kickoff Workshop', leading to 'Digital Strategy', followed by 'SHL Living Design Workshop' and 'Impact Assessment'. Each segment includes tasks such as 'Client feedback for next phase', 'User Engagement (Users)', 'Quality Assurance', and 'Internal Delivery'. Key milestones are marked and categorized, including 'Overall Scheme Frozen', 'First Pricing', and 'Development and Coordination'. The colors of the arrows and circles differentiate between main milestones, processes that depend on the project, and typical progress. Additionally, there are notations for 'SHL Innovations' in Sustainability and Digital, alongside SHL BD Communication.

**[Image from page 24]:** The image features the text arranged in a simple, bold font that reads "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN". The text is presented in all capital letters and has a clean, modern aesthetic, conveying a professional look. The letters are prominently displayed against a light gray background, emphasizing the clarity and legibility of the text.

•••

#### PARALLEL PROCESSES TO CONSIDER

**Planning authorities:** the timing varies from country and project. Dialog with local authorities. Planning permit procedures often happen at the end of the phase.

DK: Regulatory project ourselves

Outside DK: local consultant takes the dialog, we provide all graphic material.

**User Engagement:** more common in public or civic projects, where users need to be involved on an ongoing basis and provide input into the project brief.

**[Image from page 25]:** The image is a circular flowchart illustrating a project development process. It features several stages, with directional arrows indicating the progression from one stage to another. The stages are labeled as follows: 01 - Go IN (Kick-off workshop), 02 - Go OUT (User engagement), 03 - Go DEEP (Engineering strategies, Peer Review), 04 - Go HIGH (Quality Assurance, DD Delivery), and 05 - Go OUT (Client approves final design). Additional activities such as 'Knowledge sharing', 'Digital strategy, BIM Plan and setup', and 'Adjustments and Detailing of project' are also included, positioned around the circle. An accompanying key identifies different categories including SHL Innovations: Sustainability and Digital, as well as SHL QA and Peer review. The flowchart emphasizes collaboration, client engagement, and project quality at each phase.

**[Image from page 26]:** The image features the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" presented in bold, uppercase letters. The font is sleek and modern, with a strong emphasis on geometric shapes. The text is centered on a light gray background, creating a stark contrast that enhances readability.

### DESIGN DEVELOPMENT SHL process

FACADES: Determine main details to ensure quality level

INTERIOR: Determine main details to ensure quality level

- Construction Tender Package incl. BIM model.
- DESIGN MANUAL

To maintain quality level and create overview for the client.

Depending on the project, it can be just illustrative or binding. This will determine the extent and level of detail. Anyways it is a nice-to-have, a tool to capture information that might otherwise be missed moving forward.

Ideally, it will show all information not appearing on drawings, such as: visualizations, overall concept, design intent, site considerations, Planning process, materiality, colour palette, Interior design strategy, Access and maintenance, Signage, Wayfinding, Lighting, Art, etc.

### CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS SHL process

#### **GENERAL DESIGN PROCESS**

Detailing to a level that allows the contractor to build the project. All design information required to manufacture and construct the project completed.

Beginning of the phase: very important to check if we are under a new contract and its contents after the contractor is on-board. There might be new conditions.

- Develop architectural and engineering technical design

### CONSTRUCTION ADMINISTRATION SHL process

#### **GENERAL DESIGN PROCESS**

Manufacturing, construction and commissioning completed at the end of the phase. Design work is only Site Queries as required.

It is very important to run them by the Quality Assurance plan, especially if new details or solutions are put forward by the contractor and so on.

#### • Core tasks:

- Finalise Site Logistics
- Manufacture Building Systems and construct building
- Monitor progress against Construction Programme
- Inspect Construction Quality
- Resolve Site Queries as required
- Undertake Commissioning of building
- Prepare Building Manual

#### • Other processes:

carry out Construction Phase Plan Comply with Planning Conditions related to construction

**[Image from page 29]:** The image presents a flowchart depicting the stages of a construction project. It includes the following main milestones arranged in a circular format: 1. 'Go in' (01), which leads to 'Construction begins on-site', 'Site supervision starts', 'Monitor progress against Construction programme', and 'Inspect Construction Quality'. 2. 'Go out' (03), leading to 'Handover of building', including steps for 'Contractor has been appointed', 'SHL drafting/planning', 'finalise site logistics', and 'Manufacture Building Systems'. 3. 'Go deep' (03) and 'Go high' (04) stages, indicating the progression towards the 'Built project' and the 'End of CA'. The flowchart features arrows connecting these stages, with dotted detailing for tasks 'as required' linked to site queries and quality assurance (QA).
