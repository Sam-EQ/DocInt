### SCHMIDT HAMMER LAGGEN

#### PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

#### SHL process between Concept and Project design

**[Image from page 5]:** The image outlines the process between concept and project design phases in a construction project. It is divided into two main sections: 'Concept Design' and 'Project Design Phases'. Under 'Concept Design', there are two phases: 'Prequalification' and 'Sketch/Competition'. Below these phases, contract preparation details are noted: 'Clarification of Procurement method' and 'Ideal contract signing or payment plan is established'. In the 'Project Design Phases', there are four sub-phases: 'Schematic Design', 'Detailed Development', 'Construction Documents', and 'Construction Administration', with corresponding percentage allocations: 20% for Schematic Design, 20% for Detailed Development, 45% for Construction Documents, and 15% for Construction Administration. Risks associated with contractor appointments and an SHL Scope of Work graph are also depicted, showing a downward trend in scope over the design phases.

**[Image from page 6]:** The image displays the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" in a bold, sans-serif font. The text is presented in uppercase letters and is aligned vertically, emphasizing a modern and minimalist design aesthetic. The background is a light gray color, further highlighting the stark black text.

#### **CONTRACT PREPARATION**

#### Overview and references

Ideally the contract should be ready before Schematic Design phase starts.

If the contract signing is delayed or under works when SD starts, it is **necessary** to establish a payment plan until the contract is in place.

#### ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT METHOD

### Quick overview

Which type of project is it? Key information - Impact on scope and project dynamics.

For example, often the client or contractor have an internal or external cost consultant in which we feed the architectural items. But in the scenario where the Architect has the Projekt ledelse in a Totalrådgiver scheme, we are responsible for the project economy.

- Clarification of **procurement method** Turnkey contract? Tender

**[Image from page 7]:** The image presents a diagram featuring a central circle labeled "PROJECT" with several other circles surrounding it. The surrounding circles are connected to the central circle and are labeled as follows: "Client" (which includes sub-items like private client, pension fund, state, city, developer), "Advisors" (list includes architect, landscape architect, engineers, interior architect), "Contractor" (with the sub-item "subcontractors"), "Suppliers", and "Authorities". Each surrounding circle has a dashed outline.

#### **Project organisation types:**

Fagentreprise Tender in Subcontracts

**[Image from page 7]:** The image is a flowchart outlining a construction project management structure. At the top is the 'Client,' who is connected to a 'Client advisor.' Below them is 'Design Management,' highlighted in green. This central node branches down to 'General Contractor,' which further splits into five components: 'HVAC,' 'Plumbing,' 'Electricity,' 'core + shell,' 'Carpenter,' 'Paint,' and 'Interior.' Each component represents different aspects or trades involved in the construction or renovation process.

Hovedentreprise **General Contractor**

The term "partnering" is applied to a form of cooperation in a construction project that is based on dialogue, trust, openness and early involvement of all parties. The project is carried out under a common objective formulated by joint activities and based on common economic interests.

Partnering Joint venture

**[Image from page 7]:** The image is an organizational chart illustrating the structure of a client project management system. At the top is the "Client" node, which branches out to a "Client advisor" on the right and a green-colored node labeled "Design Management" in the center. Below "Design Management," there are three separate branches labeled "Contract 1," "Contract 2," and "Contract 3." "Contract 1" specifies "Plumbing HVAC," "Contract 2" states "Core and shell," and "Contract 3" notes "Interior Paint ceilings." To the right of these contracts, there is an additional branch labeled "Electricity."

### INTERNAL HAND OVER WORKSHOP

#### Workshop knowledge sharing from competition phase

SHL Transfer of knowledge between Concept phase and Design phase.

What does SHL as a company see as an opportunity on this project?

Ideally the workshop should take place when the PM and the PA of Schematic design phase are in place and will lead the workshop.

If the team is already set up, it would be good they also attend the workshop.

It is important to write a summary of the workshop that will be saved in the server in the project folder.

# PLANNING/TEAM SET UP Deliverables, Planning, Staffing

## Deliverables and responsabilities

- Check the contract first. Often SHL needs to come up with a list of deliverables that will get approved by the contractor/client. In DK, it is on the client scope to specify what they want from YBL18.
- Involve SHL/PW digital team for the digital deliverables.
- Check or make the project organization chart.
- Identify deliverables under SHL direct responsability or under a consultant/subconsultant responsability. Make sure to share the organization chart and deliverables and responsabilities list with all collaborators.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image features a simple graphic design consisting of a large black circle outlined against a white background. Above the circle, there is a small vertical black line or rectangle extending downward. The arrangement creates a minimalist look, emphasizing the contrast between the black shapes and the white background.

### **SHL Planning**

- 1. Timeframe + deliverables-responsibilities + other relevant info: Extract relevant info for SHL workflow.
- 2. Elaborate a **timeschedule with milestones** including:
  - **Deadlines** for deliverables
  - Recurrent meetings or workshops, user engagement sessions, planning process
  - Specific **design tasks**. Add an estimate timing to them.
  - Include the **Quality Assurance plan** milestones. Plan it with the QA manager according to the SHL Quality Assurance Standard.
  - Plan other SHL internal milestones, such as Digital team, Sustainability, Peer Review, etc.
- 3. Involve the partner in charge. When approved, share with team internally and if relevant also externally.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image features two overlapping circles, one filled with gray and the other empty (white). The circles are positioned horizontally adjacent to each other, sharing a common area where they intersect. Below the circles, there is a vertical dashed line that extends downward, indicating they may be part of a larger diagram or may lead to further details below.

#### Staffing

Phase fee + Planning are the base for the project staffing.

Discuss with Partner in charge/Finance/Operations director and agree on skills and FTE required for project.

**[Image from page 9]:** The image features a simple black graphic design consisting of three distinct elements. At the top, there is a vertical line that connects to a circle below it.

#### Living Design - Sustainability process

#### **LIVING DESIGN**

Living Design enables architects to maintain design authority while accessing specialised knowledge across environmental performance, lifecycle assessment, social shifts and regulatory compliance.

Our sustainability and Innovation group provides project teams with the technical capacity and cross-disciplinary coordination tools necessary to deliver a unified sustainability and design vision, even when confronted with conflicting aims from stakeholders and consultants.

The service operates through structured meetings, workshops, systematic tracking tools, including our proprietary Palette platform—featuring practice cards that provide gateway access to extensive technical knowledge across sustainability topics from P&W and select external experts. This approach ensures that the

design intent established during concept phases remains coherent through project development, while enabling architects to confidently engage with clients, engineers, consultants, and specialist disciplines.

Q:\Denmark\Archive\SHL Design\ SUS-TAINABILITY\HJC\Presentations\241004 PA PM Presentation.pptx

#### **PROCESS INTEGRATION**

Living Design transforms sustainability from a parallel workstream into an integrated design methodology, enabling architects to deliver projects that achieve both design excellence and measurable environmental performance.

We integrate with standard project phases in five primary ways:

- Living Design Handover Meetings
  bridge concept to detailed design phases, assessing project aspirations, constraints, opportunities, and focus areas to maintain relevant sustainability drivers.
- Topic-based Workshops at schematic design ensure design intent continuity. Further workshops address specific areas like comfort analysis, circularity mapping, or lifecycle assessment.
- Palette Platform Integration offers practice cards on sustainability topics, connecting teams to up-to-date research, how-to-guides and technical knowledge across the broader firm without compromising project momentum or design authority.
- **Focused research**: Projects often require a specific deep dive into particular sustainability topics to preserve design

intent. This could be due to a misalignment with stakeholders and consultants, or because of a knowledge shortfall.

- Sustainability scope deliverables:

There is often extra project scope that is best handled by SHL rather than external consultants. We have a long list of services normally taken by specialists that can be performed in-house, giving architects a closer relationship with the analysis that influences design decisions.

Living Design scales with project complexity. It provides tracking of design drivers and communication tools while offering specialist services such as environmental simulations and circular economy strategies for projects in progress.

#### Working environment

#### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

Currently a new system complying with the new ISO regulation is been devel-opped.

In the meantime, the current system to be used works as follows:

#### 1. Working internally.

Check first if by contract, for internal work, a certain working platform, folder structure (ISO compliance, others) and/ or file sharing system needs to be used in the project.

**Sharepoint.** Projects with other P&W offices need to happen in Sharepoint, where access can be controlled and authorship tracked.

The folder structure should follow the PW folder structure, implemented by the SHL Digital team in Copenhagen shown in this slide.

Sharepoint P&W presentation: [https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/port-folio-item/core-exchange-sharepoint-teams-q12024/](https://digitalpractice.perkinswill.com/port-folio-item/core-exchange-sharepoint-teams-q12024/)

**[Image from page 18]:** The image contains a text layout describing the storage locations for project files. It is divided into three sections, each labeled distinctly:
1. **P:\ DESIGN** - This section indicates that it stores modeling, graphics, and presentation files, serving as a permanent storage for deliverables, except for BIM models.
2. **SharePoint** - This section refers to files categorized as Deliverables for external transfers, Design Team files for SHL and consultants, and SHL Team files specifically for SHL.
3. **BIM360** - This section indicates that it holds Revit and associated files. Each section is visually emphasized with purple-colored boxes.

**[Image from page 18]:** The image illustrates a flowchart titled 'Folder Deliverables.' At the top, there is a rectangular box labeled 'Deliverables.' Below it, an arrow points to another rectangular box formatted with a space for a date and issue name, labeled as 'Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name.' Below this, there are two additional rectangular boxes labeled 'Handover' and 'Evaluation,' respectively. The overall layout appears organized and structured for documenting deliverables in a folder.

**[Image from page 18]:** The image presents a flowchart titled "Folder Design Team". At the top, it mentions that the folder is shared with consultants having direct contracts with SHL. Below this, a main node labeled "Design Team" branches into four segments. The first segment is labeled "01-Predesign Programming" and lists items including Code Analysis, Existing Conditions-Surveys, FFE-Inventories, Geotechnical Reports, Room Data Sheets, and Space Programming. The second segment is labeled "02-Planning/Design" and includes Drawing Sheet Log, Master Plan Studies, and Report Originals. The third segment, "03-Presentations," specifies the format for naming presentations as "yyyy-mm-dd\_Presentation\_Name." The last segment, labeled "04-Living Design," lists categories such as Energy-Atmosphere, Health-Equity, Material-Product, and Site-Water.

**[Image from page 18]:** The image is an organizational chart for the SHL Team, labeled 'Folder SHL Team' and intended for internal use only. It displays a hierarchical structure with four main categories: 01-ProjectMgmt, 02-ClientCorresp, 03-ContractorCorresp, and 04-Specifications. Under '01-ProjectMgmt', there are five subcategories: Billing, Consultant Agreements, Cost Management, Digital Execution Plan, and Client Agreement Schedules. Under '02-ClientCorresp', there's a subcategory labeled MeetingDocs. '03-ContractorCorresp' and '04-Specifications' are also main categories but without listed subcategories in the chart. The overall design features soft red boxes for the categories and a clean layout.

#### Working environment

#### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT**

**P:Drive:** for modelling, graphics and deliverables. Permanent archiving of deliverables (except BIM models), correspondence and legal documents.

P:Drive Folder structure can be found here: P:\Denmark\SHL Project Folder

Master

#### 2. Sharing externally.

Some clients want a specific platform for sharing files and documents, such as Dalux, Byggeweb, iBinder, DROPS etc. In each project, the archiving strategy of the documents in these platforms needs to be agreed separately with the Digital team.

If there is not such a system established, **Sharepoint** should be used as sharing platform with external parties. Reach out to the Digital team to establish the folders and permissions.

We-transfer, mail attachments or screen-shots in e-mails are NOT valid methods of sharing information with external parties.

#### 3. BIM environment.

**BIM 360** is the working environment for Revit files and all associated files. If by contract you need to use a different platform, please contact the Digital team before agreeing to it.

#### Folder structure and Permissions

- Each company or team will receive a folder which they alone can edit
- All consultants will have the ability to view, download and link to any file in the project.
- Perkins&Will does not allow for external team members to be project admins; however we grant full control to your company folder to allow for the adding and removal of team members to that company folder.

**[Image from page 19]:** This image features a section of a document management system displaying various permission levels for accessing files. Each permission level is listed with a description of what actions a user can perform. The levels are:
1. 'View Only': Users can view documents and add markups/issues but cannot upload or download content.
2. 'View + Download': Users can view and download documents and add markups/issues, but cannot upload content, indicated in a red box.
3. 'Upload Only': Users can upload content but cannot view folder contents.
4. 'View + Download + Upload': Users can upload, download, and view content, including adding markups/issues.
5. 'View + Download + Upload + Edit': Users can review, publish content, and edit or delete folder/subfolder content, also highlighted in a red box.
6. 'Folder Control': Provides full administrative controls for managing folder access and title blocks. On the right side, the 'Document Manager' interface shows a navigation panel with folders including 'Plans' and 'Project Files', which contains subfolders for various disciplines (e.g., ARCH - PW, CIVIL, ELECT, etc.) with placeholders for company names.

**[Image from page 20]:** The image features the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" prominently displayed in a bold, sans-serif font. The words are arranged in three lines, with 'SCHMIDT' at the top, 'HAMMER' in the middle, and 'LASSEN' at the bottom, all in uppercase letters. The design has a minimalistic aesthetic with a light gray background.

#### Archiving a project phase

#### Project Archiving process for the end of each phase

It is extremely important to archive each phase in the P: Drive, under Project / 09 Phase submission.

There should be a folder for each phase, in which there should be:

- final delivered material (in all formats delivered to the client, including the BIM models)
- handover notes or stage report
- phase evaluation

If the project is kept only in Sharepoint, the same documentation should be saved here:

**[Image from page 20]:** The image presents a flowchart titled "Deliverables" at the top. Below it, a line leads down to a box labeled "Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name". Further down, there are two additional boxes labeled "Handover" and "Evaluation", positioned one below the other. The flowchart is structured to show a sequential process, with all boxes in shades of green.

**[Image from page 20]:** The image displays a file directory structure on a computer screen. The directory, titled 'This PC', shows various folders related to a project based in Denmark for the year 2024. The folders are organized with titles indicating different aspects of the project, such as '01 Concept Design', '02 Areas', '03 Models', and '09 Phase Submissions', which is highlighted in red. Other folders include '05 Presentations', '08 Sustainability', and '10 Current Drawings'. The modified dates next to each folder indicate the last time they were updated, with '09 Phase Submissions' being last modified on '12-05-2025' at '11:18'. Each folder is represented as an icon alongside its name, indicating they are all file folders.

#### E-mail archiving:

At the beginning of the project ideally, ask IT to create a shared mailbox for the project and provide them with the list of users needing access to it. This address should be put in copy of all project correspondence.

If this address was never created, ask IT to do it. In any case, when a phase is over, e-mails should be archived there by dragging them directly to it. This should be explained in the phase Handover notes (see SHL Templates / Other useful tools in this document).

If nothing works, Outlook classic allows to convert mail folders into an indexed Adobe PDF docu-ment.

**[Image from page 21]:** The image features the text 'SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN' presented in a bold, modern typeface. The text is aligned vertically and occupies a prominent position against a light gray background. Each word is displayed in capital letters, with 'SCHMIDT' positioned above 'HAMMER' and 'HAMMER' above 'LASSEN', creating a striking typographic composition.

#### Sharing in Project Hub

**[Image from page 21]:** The image presents a project overview for the "MMU Library Transformation" by Hawkins/Brown Architects, displayed on a digital interface. The left side features a section labeled "Deliverables" with a flowchart indicating a link structure that leads to the format "Yyyy-mm-dd\_Issue\_Name", followed by categories such as "Handover" and "Evaluation". On the right side is a digital screenshot detailing the project information, including project title, architectural firm, location in Manchester, and various links such as "Stage 2 Draft" and "3D model". The project is identified under the categories of Civic and Cultural, specifically Libraries + Learning Common, with a size of 22,100 square meters and a budget of 165,000.00 GBP.

**[Image from page 21]:** The image displays a simple, stylized icon on a blue background. The icon consists of a location pin symbol above a representation of a person. The design is minimalist, using white lines to outline the pin and the figure. The location pin is circular at the top, with a hollow center, while the figure below is depicted with geometric shapes suggesting a person. The overall style is clean and modern.

Project Map

**[Image from page 21]:** The image depicts a world map with various blue circles indicating different locations. Each circle is sized according to a numeric value, with larger circles representing higher values. The values displayed inside the circles include: 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 23, 26, 27, 40, 54, 65, 91, 96, 159, 229, 566, 900, 817, 2.5k, 3.4k, 4k, 3.4k, 13k, 27k, and 54. The map shows a concentration of the highest values in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, while some locations have values as low as 2. Additionally, there are areas marked with a yellow dot, suggesting a specific point of interest. Overall, the map visualizes data distribution geographically, showcasing varying numerical values across different regions.

At the end of each phase, the PA should add a link to the Deliverables folder in the P: Drive into the Project Hub.

This is an important step of a process to improve knowledge-sharing across the project teams in the office.

## SCHMIDT HAMMER LAGGEN

### A CONTINUOUS PROCESS

One circle leading into another

**[Image from page 22]:** The image presents a diagram with concentric circles labeled with different abbreviations and a central concept. At the center is the word "Concept." Surrounding it are four layers labeled from innermost to outermost as follows: "SD" (presumably representing a specific designation), "DD" (potentially standing for a different designation), "CD" (possibly meaning conceptual designation), and "CA" (likely indicating a broader classification). The circles are delineated differently, with the innermost circle as a solid line, the next two as dashed lines, and the outermost circle also as a solid line. An arrow pointing right appears above the central concept, suggesting movement or direction.

# CIRCLE OF INNOVATION SHL Concept methodology - Phases

**[Image from page 22]:** The image presents a circular flowchart divided into five segments, illustrating a process. Each segment is labeled with a number and a title. Starting from the top and moving clockwise:

1. **ANALYZE**: This section emphasizes understanding the client and assignment, planning, and problem-finding.

2. **EXPLORE**: Focuses on broadening perspectives by exploring limits, generating ideas, and identifying values.

3. **PRODUCE**: Highlights actions such as refining, communicating, and implementing production strategies.

4. **GO HIGH**: Indicates a step of taking actions in a high-level context.

5. **COMMUNICATE**: Involves archiving, evaluating, and passing over information.

The segments are interconnected, suggesting a cyclical workflow where each stage feeds into the next, reflecting an iterative process.

**[Image from page 22]:** The image features a text layout emphasizing the word "DEVELOP" in large, bold, lowercase letters at the center. Above it, the number "03" is displayed in a larger, lighter font. To the right, there are four smaller text lines, each giving a keyword or phrase related to the development process: "Evaluate," "Focus," "Development of concept," and "Optimize". The overall color scheme uses light purple for the text elements, against a simple, white background.

**[Image from page 23]:** The image features the text "SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN" displayed prominently in bold, black font. The arrangement of the words is stacked vertically, with "SCHMIDT" on the top line, followed by "HAMMER" in the middle, and "LASSEN" on the bottom line. The background is a light grey, providing a contrast that emphasizes the dark text.

#### PARALLEL PROCESSES TO CONSIDER

**Planning authorities:** the timing varies from country and project. Often an Impact assessment is required early on for the authorities to approve.

**User Engagement:** clarification of potential user processes early on. If public or civic project it can be a substantial workload, in person meetings where users provide input into the project brief.

**[Image from page 23]:** The image presents a circular flowchart illustrating a project planning process with various stages and milestones. The central theme is labeled as 'Overall Scheme Frozen.' The flowchart contains several phases: '01. Go In,' '02. Go Minute,' '03. Go Deep,' '04. Go High,' '05. Go Out,' and an archiving phase titled 'Archive & Evaluation.' Each phase includes specific activities: for example, 'Kick Off Workshop,' 'SHL Living Design Workshop,' 'Digital Strategy: Site Visit, Analysis,' and 'Impact Assessment.' There are indicators for quality assurance and delivery stages, including 'Confirm final SD assumptions' and 'Internal Delivery.' The chart visually connects these stages in a clockwise rotation, with arrows indicating the flow of work. A key at the bottom references different innovation types related to sustainability and communication.

**[Image from page 24]:** The image features the text 'SCHMIDT HAMMER LASSEN' displayed in a bold, modern sans-serif font. The text is arranged in a stacked format, with 'SCHMIDT' on the top line, 'HAMMER' in the middle, and 'LASSEN' on the bottom line. The overall design has a minimalist aesthetic with no additional imagery or color, primarily focusing on the typography against a light gray background.

PARALLEL PROCESSES TO CONSIDER

**Planning authorities:** the timing varies from country and project. Dialog with local authorities. Planning permit procedures often happen at the end of the phase.

DK: Regulatory project ourselves

Outside DK: local consultant takes the dialog, we provide all graphic material.

**User Engagement:** more common in public or civic projects, where users need to be involved on an on-going basis and provide input into the project brief.

**[Image from page 25]:** The image depicts a circular workflow diagram related to project management, segmented into five main phases labeled with numbers: 01 - Go IN, 02 - Go OUT, 03 - Go DEEP, 04 - Go HIGH, and 05 - Go OUT. Each phase has associated tasks or events including 'SHL Staffing/Planning', 'Digital Strategy', 'User Engagement', 'Quality Assurance', 'DD Delivery', and 'Client Approval'. Additionally, it includes various checkpoints such as 'Pre-planning applications (authorities)', 'Engineering strategies scenario', and 'Client feedback'. The circle illustrates the interconnectedness of these phases in a project lifecycle, with arrows indicating the flow of progress and a key indicating different categories of tasks. Color coding distinguishes between milestones and typical project timelines.
